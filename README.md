## Data Engineering for Distributed Micro-Service Pipeline
The project aims at learning to design a scalable data pipeline that can receive data from streams, combine them with knowledge repository, carry out necessary pre-processing, perform calculations, publish results. The design needs to be implemented using either Java or Python as Microservices with the use case real-time feedback application of NYC taxi services.


## Pipeline Design
The data pipeline design of the NYC taxi real-time application implements event-oriented, distributed and SOA by incorporating the principles from Complex Event Processing (CEP) and Microservices framework. The design patterns are illustrated as 1) high-level components using Information Flow Processing (IFP) models (1), 2) flow of the data in the pipeline using decomposed components and Inter-Process Communication (IPC) of microservices (2)
